1. For an female who has a stress score of 15, what does your model predict is the probability they have pulled an all nighter?

```{r}
mod1=glm(AllNighter~Gender+AnxietyScore,family="binomial", data = Sleep)
summary(mod1)
```
```{r}
newx=data.frame(Gender=0,AnxietyScore=15)
predict(mod1,newx,type="response")
```
For a female with an anxiety score of 15, the model predicts the probability of having had an all-nighter this semester is 0.1242689
