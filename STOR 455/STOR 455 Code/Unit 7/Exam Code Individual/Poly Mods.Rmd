1. Fit a quadratic model using _Happiness_ to predict GPA and construct a scatterplot of the data with the quadratic fit.
```{r}
library(readr)
Sleep = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JA-McLean/STOR455/master/data/SleepStudy.csv")

mod1 = lm(GPA~Happiness+I(Happiness^2), data=Sleep)
summary(mod1)

plot(GPA~Happiness, data=Sleep)
curve(summary(mod1)$coef[3,1]*x^2 + summary(mod1)$coef[2,1]*x + summary(mod1)$coef[1,1], add=TRUE)
```

2. Determine if the fit would improve if a cubic term was included.
```{r}
mod2 = lm(GPA~Happiness+I(Happiness^2)+I(Happiness^3), data=Sleep)
anova(mod1, mod2)
```
Doing a nested F-test, we have a p-value greater than .05 so adding the cubic term would not significantly improve the model.
