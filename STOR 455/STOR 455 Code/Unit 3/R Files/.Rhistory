# Not super easy to read
# Takers has a negative correlation

# A nicer visual of the correlation matrix
# Dark blue = strong correlation
# Darker and bigger circle = stronger positive or negative correlation
# Type = "upper" just gives us the upper part of it, it avoids duplicate infomraiotn
# could also tell where we could have multicllinearity
# Takers may have multicolinearity from income and rank
