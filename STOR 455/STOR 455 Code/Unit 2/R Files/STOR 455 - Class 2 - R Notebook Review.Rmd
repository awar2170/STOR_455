__Example: Distance to Home__
- *Question:* How can we predict the distance from campus to home for Carolina students? 
- *Data:* Estimated distance to home (in miles) for students taking STOR 455 in a previous semester. 
- *Predictor variables:* Start with none.

__Example: Constant Model__
Y = c + Error

Where c = an unknown constant 

**Terminology** 
- "The constant c" = **parameter** of the model 
- "Sample estimate" - use data to provide a sample estimate of c 

*How should we estimate 𝑐 from data?*

*Below:* Summarize the Distance variable  - Numerical: mean and median
```{r}
# dataframe$variable_name

mean(DistanceHome$Distance)
median(DistanceHome$Distance)
```

*Below:* Summarize the Distance variable - Graphical: histogram, boxplot
```{r}
hist(DistanceHome$Distance, breaks=20)
boxplot(DistanceHome$Distance, horizontal = TRUE)
```

__Predicted Value for Response__
- Get an estimate for Y using the predictors and the model with estimated parameters. 

*Notation:* The predicted y is denoted yhat 

For the constant Model: yhat = chat 

Examples: 
yhat = chat = ybar (*sample mean) 
yhat = chat = m (sample median)

__Can we use a predictor to improve the model? __
X = Hours to travel home? 
X = Introvert? 
- Two sample t test for a difference in means 

__Model with a Binary Predictor__
Y = f(x) + Error 
where X = introversion, 
mu1 = mean distance for Extroverts 
mu2 = mean distance for Introverts 
```{r}
mean(Distance~Introvert, data=DistanceHome)

tally(~Introvert, data=DistanceHome)

sd(Distance~Introvert, data=DistanceHome)

boxplot(Distance~Introvert, data=DistanceHome, horizontal=TRUE)
```

__Two-sample T-Test Difference in Means__
*Hypothesis* 
Ho: Mu1 = Mu2
Ha: Mu1 != Mu2 

*Compare to a t-dist* 

__P-value__
- The p-value is the proportion of samples, when the H0 is true, that would be as (or more) extreme as the observed sample. 

*Below, Conclusion:* Decision: Reject H0 only when the p-value is small. 
```{r}
t.test(Distance~Introvert, data=DistanceHome)
```

__Normality?__
- The two-sample t-test assumes both samples are from normal populations

__Domestic Distance__
- Suppose that we look only at distances that are really “drivable”?
*See below* 
```{r}
Domestic = subset(DistanceHome, Distance<250)
head(Domestic)
```

- For distance home (only including students less than 250 miles from home) the Introvert variable does not improve the model significantly. 

```{r}
boxplot(Distance~Introvert, data=Domestic, horizontal=TRUE)

t.test(Distance~Introvert, data=Domestic)
```

__Inference Review: Hypothesis Testing__ 
- Suppose that we look only at distances that are really “drivable”?
*Test* 
Ho: mu1 = Mu2
Ha: mu1 != Mu2

There is a 93.3% chance that we would receive a samples with a difference as extreme as we did if the null hypothesis is true.
p-value = 0.933

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
There is not evidence to suggest that there is a difference in the number of miles from home Carolina students are (of those students 250 miles or less) based on if they are introverts or extroverts.

There is a 93.3% chance that we would receive a samples with a difference as extreme as we did if the null hypothesis is true.
p-value = 0.933

```{r}
Domestic=subset(DistanceHome,Distance<250)
```

__Domestic Distance__ 
For distance home (only including students less than 250 miles from home) the Introvert variable does not improve the model significantly. 

```{r}
t.test(Distance~Introvert, data=Domestic)
```
