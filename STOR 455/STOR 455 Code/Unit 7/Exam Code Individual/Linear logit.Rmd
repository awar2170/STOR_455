1). Build a logistic model that predicts whether a student has pulled a "AllNighter", based on their "WeekdaySleep". Comment on the linearity of the model using a emplogitplot.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(Stat2Data)
Sleep <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JA-McLean/STOR455/master/data/SleepStudy.csv")
```
```{r}
All_Nighter = glm(AllNighter~WeekdaySleep, family=binomial, data=Sleep)
summary(All_Nighter)
```
```{r}
emplogitplot1(AllNighter~WeekdaySleep, data=Sleep, ngroups=10)
```
As we can see in our summary output, our WeekdaySleep term looks significant, and looking at the plot it seems as if the points follow a linear pattern, as there is no clear curve.
