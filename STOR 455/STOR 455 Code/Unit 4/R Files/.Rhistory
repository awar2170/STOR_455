# Summary at bottom tells us the overall anova test
# Ho: coef of all the coef are zero vs the Ha: at least one is non zero <- for the ANOVA test
# Low pvalue - There is a relationship with at least one of these predictors
# Looking at the individual predictors and there are many that are very low
# The itneraction term is now a sig pvalue
# FOr a model like this for polynomial regression or the compelte second order model, when we are looking at adding categorical variables, we don't want ot pick and choose different parts of this model and keep them
# We want either a full polynomial model with all the degrees of the predictor in it or some other model
# Even though the interaction term isn't sig, we don't want to get rid of it
# Residual analysis
# Linearity looks good
# Normal looks pretty good, some devation but pretty good
# overall: Seems like a good model
# Adj R squared; almost 90% of the varability is predicted by this model
# One warning error: There are some weird things with the plot, but don't worry about that; AK is just giving us a leverage warning
# Do we need the interaction term?
# YEs, if we have the other htings
# Do we need the second order terms?
# Are any useful? Takers and linear parts of it, and the squared value
# Do the extra terms give us much improvement vs a model without it? We can't tell that from teh summary table, we have to do some drop in deviance test to tell that or a nested test
# Do we need the terms with Expend?
# A model with just tackers was a good model, and that is a subset of this one, so do we need the extra things?
