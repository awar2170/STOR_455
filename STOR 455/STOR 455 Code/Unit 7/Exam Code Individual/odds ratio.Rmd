sleep <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JA-McLean/STOR455/master/data/SleepStudy.csv")
```



Create a logistic model that predicts gender based on GPA.
```{r}
mod1 = glm(Gender~GPA, data=sleep)
```


 how does your model predict the odds of being male or female will change based on GPA?
```{r}
summary(mod1)
exp(summary(mod1)$coef[2])
```

For every 1 point increase in GPA, the odds of being male increase by a factor of .74.
